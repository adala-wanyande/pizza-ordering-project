# Pizza Ordering Project - Rose's Gourmet Pizza

## A Project Undertaken By Group 2 of SDF-PT01FI Phase 2 Moringa School

The members of the team are:
- Benard Adala Wanyande (Scrum Master)
- Roselyne Lutomia
- Faith Mitei
- Teddy Mbugua

## Description of the Project

This project is the group's attempt to implement fundamental React concepts learnt during the current phase of learning in class like components, props and state management. Other concepts like utilizing API data in React and client-side routing are also implemented within this project.

The React app is a pizza restaurant website that allows users a user to browse through the home page, about us page and contact us page to learn more about the restaurant. The website also offers a menu page where users can select from a variety of delicious pizzas and add them to a virtual cart. Once the user has their desired menu items to the cart they are able to make an order in preparation for a hypothetical delivery.

All this is done within a single page application, developed from scratch by team!

## Link to the Live Site

This project is still in development but upon submission, we will update the `README.md` with the link to the website.

## Project Set Up Instructions (If you want to run the app on your machine)

First, fork the repository using your Github account.

Once you have forked the repository, you can clone the code directly onto your local machine using the `git clone` command.


On your machine in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
